## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes needs business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue. They want to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs by standing out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- We need to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- The company wants to know:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  - How well those variables describe the bike demands
- Dataset being used is Bike sharing data from American market from 2018 and 2019.


## Conclusions
Below are the variables affecting the dependent variable cnt with given coefficents

cnt  = yr x 0.2502 + holiday x -0.1090 + windspeed x -0.2611 + summer x 0.1176 + winter x 0.0345 + clear x 0.3084 + cloudy x 0.2067 + Aug x 0.1727 + Jan x -0.2019 + Sep x 0.2035 $ + 0.1468
